# GET REQUEST ROUTING FILE

# Routes will be automatically redirected
#  to the controller with the correspondent name.
#  For example, DOMAIN/products will be directed to
#  ProductsController::get($http_params).
#  DOMAIN/products/suggestions -> ProductsController::suggestions($http_params)

# The following may be done to set up paths:

# welcome: DefaultController         --- directs DOMAIN/welcome -> DefaultController::get($http_params)
# hello: DefaultController.main      --- directs DOMAIN/hello   -> DefaultController::main($http_params)
# products:                          --- 1-level hierarchies are also supported
#    parse: DefaultController
#    count: DefaultController.main

# Routes in this file will only influence GET requests.
#  To set up POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests
#  edit the corresponding files
